        The BNSharp.Plugins namespace contains interfaces that can be implemented to extend intrinsic BN# functionality.
        By implementing these interfaces and then registering the appropriate objects with BN#, many changes to the 
        core functionality could be made, such as adding support for realm server connections, changing the login
        sequence, or implementing Warden.

        BN# can be instructed to parse packets at different priorities.  For example, supposing a moderation client 
        wants to handle User Joined events immediately.  By implementing <see cref="BNSharp.Plugins.IPacketPriorityProvider">IPacketPriorityProvider</see>, 
        your client can register custom priorities for ChatEvent packets, which permit them to be handled sooner when multiple 
        packets are in the parsing queue.  They can also be parsed manually by registering a custom 
        <see cref="BNSharp.Plugins.ParseCallback">ParseCallback</see>.  Custom parsers are expected to behave by 
        maintaining their references in the chain and calling handlers higher up the chain when appropriate.
